General:
--------

Deadly Cobra is an SDL-based game similar in gameplay to the classic
Nibbles or snake game. Basically the point of the game is to eat as many 
pebbles (in our case "Men") as possible without eating yourself or 
hitting a wall.  Features include both single and multiplayer modes,
cool 2-D graphics and energizing music for each level.

This project was originally designed to compete in No Starch Press's
game cometition, but has continued to evolve and grow beyond the
December 1st 2001 deadline.

From its conception DeadlyCobra has been designed with simplicity and
size in mind. We have kept the design simple, so it should never have
to be much larger than 1 MB.
