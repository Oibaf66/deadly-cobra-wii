Future Plans
------------
Get make install to work
Add animation to the men
Add enemy (mongoose?/lawnmower/snowblower)
Create hiding spots for the snake and/or 'underground' passageways (to avoid obstacles).
Create power ups (invulnerablity, etc?)
Snake shoots something at enemies? men? obstacles?
Poop after eating a man?
Have the controls be user configured
